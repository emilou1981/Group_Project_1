  <h3>US County Obesity Rates and Possible Linkages</h3>
  <br/>
  <p>This project investigates US county obesity rates and possible economic and demographic linkages using 2016 data from the US Census Bureau, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and County Health Rankings & Roadmaps. All data are at the county level.</p>
  <br/>
  <h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
  <br/>
  <p>For this analysis, the following additional libraries were used within the Pandas and Jupyter Notebook:</p>
  <p>   xlrd (pip install xlrd)</p>
  <p>   seaborn (pip install seaborn)</p>
  <p>   statsmodels.api (pip install -U statsmodels)</p>
  <br/>
  <h3>Variables</h3>
  <br/>
  <p>  US Census Bureau data:</p>
  <p>    SNAP Recipient (%) = (SNAP benefit recipients/population) * 100</p>
  <p>  Bureau of Economic Analysis data:</p>
  <p>    Income Per Capita</p>
  <p>  County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation:</p>
  <p>    Obesity (%)</p>
  <p>    Some College (%)</p>
  <p>    High School Graduate (%)</p>
  <p>    Unemployment (%)</p>
  <br/>
  <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
  <br/>
  <p>Do obesity rates in US counties have strong correlations with demographical and economic characteristics such as SNAP benefits, education levels, income per capita, and unemployment rates?</p>
  <br/>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <br/>
  <h3>Scatter Plots and Trendlines</h3>
  <br/>
  <p>The results of scatter plots and trendlines of the relationships of the obesity rates versus the other individual independent variables are as the following. The relationship of the obesity rates versus unemployment rates or SNAP recipient rates is a positive one. The relationship is negative between the obesity rates versus income per capita, some college or high school graduate percent. The high school graduate percent and obesity rate relationship is weaker compared to the other relationships. The relationships form around the range of 20% - 40% obesity rates.</p>
